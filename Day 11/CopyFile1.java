// Character Streams 

/*
	Java Byte streams are used to perform input and output of 8-bit bytes, whereas Java Character streams are used to perform input and output for 16-bit unicode. 
	Though there are many classes related to character streams but yhe most frequently used classes are FileReader and FileWriter.
	Though internatlly FileReader uses FileInputStream and FileWrite uses FileOutputStream but here the major difference is that FileReader reads two bytes at a time and FileWriter writes two bytes at a time.
	
	We can re-write the above example, which makes the use of these two classes to copy an input file (having unicode characters) into an output file −
